# Mixed-Authentication
Solution for laborating with forms-authentication together with windows-authentication.
The idea comes from **Mike Volodarsky** - [**IIS 7.0 Two-Level Authentication with Forms Authentication and Windows Authentication**](http://mvolo.com/iis-70-twolevel-authentication-with-forms-authentication-and-windows-authentication/). The links to the source in that article does not work anymore.
